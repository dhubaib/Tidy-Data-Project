# Tidy Data Project

## Author: Cal Al-Dhubaib

### Included files: run_analysis.R, data_dictionary.csv, Readme.md
### Included folders: tidy, UCI-HAR-Dataset

The original data files and acompanied readme & descriptions are in the folder UCI-HAR-Dataset.

I ran the R script run-analysis.R to transform the data from the subfolders "train" & "test" in the original dataset to the folder "tidy"
